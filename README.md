# [guest-browser-start-page](https://github.com/joelpurra/guest-browser-start-page)

A friendly start page for your secondary/guest browser, letting your guests know that you are OK with them using it, and that no information is saved.



## Browser support

[Firefox](http://joelpurra.github.io/guest-browser-start-page/firefox.html)



## Use case

My use case is couchsurfers who are passing by, often traveling without any device or internet connectivity themselves. They often need to borrow my computer, but I don't want them to log me out of everything I am usually logged in to in my primary browser. I also don't want their browser history intertwined with mine, nor their usernames/passwords/home addresses and other form autocomplete data.



## Security

This browser start page is not adding anything in terms of security, and it relies on the fact that you know how to set up your secondary browser to not keep data/cache/history/passwords etcetera. If you want added protection/privacy/security for you and your guest, consider using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html).

Also keep in mind that you're letting strangers use your computer.



## Requirements

1. Two browsers:
  1. Your primary browser, that you use every day, for example Google Chrome.
  1. A secondary browser, that you let your guests use, for example Firefox.



## Usage

1. Set up your secondary browser to not save any browsing history, cache, passwords, form autocomplete data and so on.
1. Set the right startpage, for example `http://joelpurra.github.io/guest-browser-start-page/firefox.html`.



## Todo

&#9744; Create the same kind of start page for other browsers.  
&#9744; Find articles on how to make your browser not save data, and link to them.  
&#9744; Use Jekyll for gh-pages.  
&#9745; Recommend the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html).
